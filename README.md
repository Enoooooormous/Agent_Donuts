# Agent_Donuts
Should I Call 911 / Agent Donuts is a "toy" project in response to the many racist 911 calls that were popping up in 2018 (not to say that they were not happening before). 
We do not have the ambition to create a revolutionary bot or to end racist calls. But if it can help some people then great. 
Agent Donuts (a Facebook chatbot), once explained the situation, would advice for or against calling 911. The classification model is a simple SVM trained on data that we generated (either by user trial or 911 transcripts). 
Unfortunately, the chatbot is not active anymore on Facebook.
